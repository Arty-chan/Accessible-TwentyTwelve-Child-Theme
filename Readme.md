## Purpose and Rationale
While newer default themes are likely more accessible than the TwentyTwelve theme, those themes have a specific look and purpose in mind (e.g. for a blog, image heavy site like a portfolio). Twentytwelve is a great simple-looking theme for a website and having worked with it before, I knew that it met many accessible requirements already.

### Why a child theme?
While I would love to see the twentytwelve theme itself become more accessible, I had to get this theme made fairly quickly. I also made a few layout changes that is not consistent with the original theme. While it meant a lot of CSS overwrites, I still made changes to only a few files.
